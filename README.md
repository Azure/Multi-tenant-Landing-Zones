This repo will house an indevelopment solution for multi-tenant Azure landing zones. 

Upon completion of the development and engineering review, this solution will likely be featured in the Cloud Adoption Framework as an Azure landing zone implementation option.
In the meantime, please feel free to share feedback on the work-in-progress development or leverage the existing Azure Landing Zone implementation options: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/implementation-options
